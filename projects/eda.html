			<h3>Overall Analysis Questions</h3>
			<ol>
				<li><s>What is the relationship between zip code of incident and zip code 
					of residence? Are most fatal overdoses likely to occur near a person’s
					home or are there particular locations in Pittsburgh? </s>
					<ul>
						<li>
							I’m mainly interested in this because I would not have thought to include 
							both pieces of data, so their inclusion feels intentional. My initial thoughts 
							would have me to believe that zip code of residence would be the more informative 
							piece of information unless there are places in/near Pittsburgh that people are more 
							likely to use drugs. 
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>

				<li>With regards to the previous question, I had not realized that the data set did 
					contain information about the zip code of residence anymore. Instead, I decided
					to simply look at the distribution of zip codes of incidents?
					<ul>
						<li>
							Similar as before, I am still interested in which areas have the
							most incidents of fatal overdoeses. As someone who is not from
							Pittsburgh, I would want to find out more about the history of 
							areas of noticeably higher rates? Are they simply the places with 
							the highest populations or could there be other factors (such as
							economic hardships or historical effects of redlining for example).
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>

				<li>Do certain drugs lead to more fatal outcomes for certain demographics? 
					On that note, is it because certain drugs are more popular with certain 
					groups or because they affect those groups more? 
					<ul>
						<li>
							I’m curious about both the social and physical aspects of drug abuse. 
							My (limited) knowledge about drug use would lead me to believe that 
							younger demographics and women might be more physically affected. 
							I’m also somewhat aware of the history of the “War on Drugs” and how 
							it targeted impoverished communities of color and this may relate to 
							the earlier question.  
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>

				<li>Is there any pattern between the number of fatal outcomes on a temporal level? 
					Do they mainly occur on a certain time of day or months out a year? How has the 
					frequency changed in recent years? 
					<ul>
						<li>
							I don’t particularly have any assumptions about this question besides 
							that I imagine that most fatal overdoses would occur at nighttime since 
							I’d imagine that’s when most people use drugs (and it’s harder to seek 
							help from emergency services). Patterns of drug overdoses across multiple 
							years would be interesting and linked with earlier questions, it might be interesting to see 
							how it might be connected to the countries’ economic health (e.g. is drug 
							overdose positively correlated with higher unemployment rates?). 
						</li>

			<h2>Discoveries & Insights</h2>

				<figcaption>
				In the dataset, there were 390 recorded values for the incident zip code which 
				is where the medical examiner's office receives the body. However, many zip codes
				had only 1 recorded case, so I displayed only the top 20 zip codes in terms of
				number of fatal overdoses. Notably, the top zip codes are all across the rivers
				from the area of Pittsburgh that contains downtown and CMU. 
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<img src="../images/numbers.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
				For each entry in the dataset, there can be up to 10 drugs that could be recorded
				based on the autopsy drug. The figure above displayes the number of overdoses 
				based on the number of drugs found at the time of overdose. Since a noticeably
				large amount of deaths occur with two or three drugs found, this will add 
				to the number of possible combinations of drugs interactions.

				<img src="../images/demographics.png" width="500" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
				While there is data for different racial groups, the dataset consists almost
				entirely of data from "Black or African American" and "White" groups. The data is 
				split by sex with Female on the left and Male on the right. 
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<img src="../images/years.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
				There are notable trends in the number of overdoses with a large peak in 
				2016 and a sharp frop off at 2017. We see a moderate increase in 2020-2022. 
				However, this raises questions about the accuracy of the data without investigating
				further. 
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<img src="../images/months.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
				Interestingly, there seems be no noticeable differences in the number of overdoses 
				from month to month. 
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<img src="../images/hours.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
				Contrary to what I believed, the most number of recorded overdoses seem to take place 
				druing the afternoon.

			<h2>Summary</h2>

			<p> Using what we discussed in class and in the readings, I decieded to focus on only one
				variable at a time even though my quesitons were more intended for relationships 
				between the columns. The EDA I performed helped me immediately discover issues with 
				the data set.
